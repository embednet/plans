If ArsTechnica were to interview us about this project, how would that interview look like?

# What's the core concept behind your radical new idea for the internet, embednet?

The internet has a serious architectural flaw. It’s disorganized. Finding good content digging through an infinite number of websites is extremely hard. 

People and businesses have become hostages to platforms and aggregators. Developers are not able to build applications that connect information because you need centralized aggregators to find anything.

We want to do something about it.

# How does your solution propose to address this disorganization and dependency on platforms and aggregators?

Our project is based on the idea of pre-classifying content based on what it’s about, how well-organized and how old it is.

Then, rather than publishing your content to a static website and waiting for engines to find and index it, the content is automatically sliced and diced and that data is stored in a collaborative distributed index.

Users that want to consume content can search through the index, and it can automatically surface content that they like. Developers can now build applications that truly connect information because they can find anything using an open protocol.

# How do you plan to ensure the quality and accuracy of content classification in this distributed index?

We are going to use open LLM models run in nodes owned by the Users or the community, to run quality classifiers and use things like embeddings to narrowly categorize everything.

Each  will have their own model for recommended content, but they own it, not a third-party.

# What measures are you implementing to protect  privacy, especially considering the personalized nature of content recommendations?

Your recommendation models are yours and they run on your computer. Alternatively you can hire a service to host your models for you, but there will be many options to choose from and you won’t be stuck with one provider knowing everything about you and everyone else.

The service could be free to use if folks create ads-supported providers. This is important because not everyone can pay for a subscription.

There is nothing intrinsically wrong with ads, per se, as long as they don’t stay in the way of offering the best content to people at all times.

# How do you plan to maintain a high level of content relevance and  satisfaction while integrating ads into the system?

That is going to be up to the model hosting providers. We are focused on the content distribution.

What are the next steps for your project, and what timeline do you envision for wider public adoption?

The core technology is built. We know we can make a scalable network that delivers content based on personalization models and that it’s fast — if it took days for you to hear about the latest news of your favorite game’s competitive scene, that would be pointless.

Now we are putting everything together to offer a compelling  experience. Folks can already try our project and provide feedback, but it’s probably only to make sense for technical folks. We are working towards a 1.0 launch but that’s at least a year away still.

# What kind of feedback have you received from early testers, and how has it influenced the development of your project?

We had users coming in, trying to find content in our network and realizing our classifier was missing something, and submitting a fix in 30 minutes. Open-source projects are great.

# What are the main advantages to users?

Decentralization and Ownership: users or communities owning and running their content recommendation models directly on their devices or choosing their hosting service. This decentralization ensures that users have control over their data and are not solely dependent on a single provider.

Quality and Relevance of Content: The use of open LLM (Large Language Models) for content classification and recommendation ensures that content is pre-classified based on quality and relevance. This approach aims to surface the most relevant and high-quality content to users automatically.

Privacy Protection: Since recommendation models are owned and operated by the users themselves, their privacy is inherently protected. There is less risk of a single entity having access to vast amounts of personal data.

Reduced Dependency on Centralized Platforms: By moving away from traditional content distribution and discovery platforms, users and businesses can avoid becoming hostages to the algorithms and business models of a few dominant platforms.

Adaptability and Community Involvement: The project's open-source nature allows for rapid feedback and improvements from the community. users can directly contribute to refining content classifiers, ensuring the system evolves to meet  needs effectively.

Accessibility and Cost-effectiveness: The possibility of ad-supported model hosting providers offers a free-to-use option, making the service accessible to a broader audience. This inclusivity ensures that users have choices and are not forced into paying for subscriptions unless they choose to.

Personalization without Compromise: The system promises personalized content recommendations without compromising  privacy or content quality, addressing a common concern with current content distribution models.

This model aims to create a more organized, user-centric internet, where content discovery is efficient, privacy is protected, and community contributions drive continuous improvement.
